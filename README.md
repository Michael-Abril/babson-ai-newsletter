# The AI Pulse

### Babson College – AI for Entrepreneurs by Mikey Abril

Your weekly cheat code for using AI better than 99% of people.

Every Friday, The AI Pulse breaks down exactly what's happening in AI and what Babson students should actually do about it. No jargon, no fluff. Just the stuff that gives you a real competitive edge as an entrepreneur.

## Why This Exists

Most people use AI as a fancy search engine. Open ChatGPT, ask a question, close it. But AI can do so much more: validate a business idea in a weekend, automate 80% of your market research, build an MVP without a dev team, and create investor-ready pitch decks in hours instead of weeks.

The AI Pulse exists to close that gap. Each issue is written specifically for Babson students and filtered through the lens of entrepreneurship. This is how you actually learn to use AI, not just chat with it.
